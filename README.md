# karlel_os_test
A basic OS to understand and document the basics plus crazy ideas

# goals of the project:

- PORTABILITY: starting from the guide available at http://wiki.osdev.org, develope a simple OS portable between my dev boards.

- KNOWLEDGE OF BARE METAL: understand in details the boot sequence of an embedded system, create my own run time (memory segmentation - boot.s - , placement of segments in memory - linker script -, ...)

- TEST NEW LANGUAGES: e.g. a new "bare bones" in languages such as haskell or rust?
